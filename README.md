Its NOT a project
Its a practice code
All necessary code to understand what python is and how it works
To achieve mastery in python, you need to practice by writing codes
Thanks Hacker Rank, LeetCode and NeetCode to present the problems to write these python codes
These are duplication of codes as we can see in different platforms
Putting those in one place saves time to practice and practice
Next I will write unit test on these codes
